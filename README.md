# Rizer (Rise up your learning with us)

## Abstract
Effective learning is important in education. One can learn things in normal manner but it will be more effective if one focuses on core topics/concepts in which they are weak instead of directly focusing on single questions. Thatâ€™s exactly what our application helps you with.

With the help of this app faculties can create quiz/MCQ based test for students and later students can analyse their score and can directly get to know in which concept they are weak, faculties can also view the overall analytics in same manner.

## Introduction
The front-end part of the project is implemented using Flutter for Web as well as Android platform. Flutter provides multi-platform support with a single codebase. Firebase as our backend, it provides all the major features such as Authentication, database (Firestore), Realtime database, storage, hosting Functions, and much more. With this project, Faculty would be able to create quizzes for students, and faculty can add quiz questions dynamically. Students will be able to give the quiz and later on, they can analyse in which area they are falling behind. 

A faculty is responsible for the creation of quiz, they need to add categories, and depending on which students will be able to analyse their report once they have appeared the quiz. The data is categorized in such a way that students will only be able to see the quiz respective to their Semester, institute and department, same goes for the faculty module , also once the quiz is successfully submitted by the student, they can analyse the result based on the category in which they are falling behind and work on accordingly to improve/rise there learning.
